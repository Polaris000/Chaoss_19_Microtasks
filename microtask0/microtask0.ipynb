    "Use this notebook implementing the Code_Changes metric (see it in MyBinder) as an example of how to collect the data, producing a single JSON file per data source, with all items (commits, issues, pull/merge requests) in it. Produce one notebook per data source (git, GitHub/GitLab issues, GitHub pull requests / GitLab merge requests) showing a summary of the contents of that file (number of items in it, and number of different identities in it counting authors/committers for git, submitters for issues and pull/merge requests). This microtask is mandatory, to show that you can retrieve data and produde a notebook showing it. In each notebook, include also the list of repositories retrieved, and the date of retrieval, using data available in the JSON file."
