# Chaoss_19_Microtasks

## General Information
This is the repository containing the microtask submissions for CHAOSS GSOC 2019. The idea I want to work on is:
**[Idea #2: Implementing CHAOSS metrics with perceval](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/issues/81)**


## My contributions and participation in CHAOSS
I started contributing to CHAOSS halfway through January, 2019 and have made several contributions.  **To avoid crowding out important information** in the README, I've mentioned all my contributions in [contributions.md](./contributions.md).

### [Microtask0](./microtask0)  
- The aim of this microtask is to understand the basics of perceval.    
- Please click on the microtask heading to proceed to the microtask directory  

### [Microtask1](./microtask1)   
- The aim of this microtask is to analyse changes on a quarterly basis without using pandas.  
- Please click on the microtask heading to proceed to the microtask directory    

### [Microtask2](./microtask2)  
- The aim of this microtask is to analyse changes on a quarterly basis using pandas.  
- Please click on the microtask heading to proceed to the microtask directory  

### [Microtask4](./microtask4)  
- The aim of this microtask is to analyse changes for all repositories for the last 3 months using pure python. 
- The repositories are to be sorted based on the total number of items (commits, issues and pull requests) created in the last 3 months.
- Please click on the microtask heading to proceed to the microtask directory 

### [Microtask5](./microtask5)  
- The aim of this microtask is to analyse changes for all repositories for the last 3 months using pandas. 
- The repositories are to be sorted based on the total number of items (commits, issues and pull requests) created in the last 3 months.
- Please click on the microtask heading to proceed to the microtask directory 

### [Microtask6](./microtask6)  
- The aim of this microtask is to perform an analysis of my choice using the data fetched by perceval. 
- I chose to perform an analysis regarding the issues from the data: number of open and closed issues, age of open issues etc.
- Please click on the microtask heading to proceed to the microtask directory 

#### Optional Microtasks
### [Microtask7]()
- The aim of this microtask is to contribute to any grimoirelab tools  
- Please check [contributions.md](./contributions.md) for all of my contributions.
  
### [Microtask8]()

## About me  
- My name is **Aniruddha Karajgi**. I am in my **second year studying Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) Computer Science** at  
Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani. I am from Mumbai, India, though my current place of residence is Hyderabad, India. 
- I have been programming in python for two years now. 
- At college, I am a **member of two technical club**, where I **work on backend development using Django** and **machine learning** (with python). I have **conducted a workshop** on the same. 
- During the summer after my freshman year at college, I **interned at CereLabs**, a startup working on deep learning applications, where I helped implement deep learning models (GANS), mainly by making data ready for the models and researching the effectiveness of those models. I also worked on cleaning and understanding open street map data, which was to be used for parsing addresses with NLP. I extensively used numpy, pandas and matplotlib during the internship.
